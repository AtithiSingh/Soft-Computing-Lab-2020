Python Environments and IDEs
We want a Python IDE/code editor for:
a)	Learning
b)	Development

1.	IDLE
IDLE is installed by default when we install Python. Major features include the Python shell window, auto-completion, syntax highlighting, smart indentation and a basic integrated debugger. But, not optimum for larger projects. 

2.	Sublime Text
Popular code editor that supports many languages including Python. Fast, highly customizable and has a huge community. We can install packages such as debugging, auto-completion, code-linting, etc. There are also various packages for scientific development, Django, Flask and so on. 

3.	Atom
Similar as Sublime Text. 

4.	PyCharm
IDE for professional developers.
Provides all major features that a good IDE should provide: 
code completion, code inspection, error-highlighting and fixes, debugging, version control system and code refactoring. It requires a computer with a larger RAM.  

5.	Jupyter Notebook
Itâ€™s an open source web application that allows us to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: Data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modelling, data visualization, machine learning and much more.
