1. TensorFlow
TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. 
It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.
Uses :
Created by the Google Brain team, TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. 
TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep learning (aka neural networking) models and algorithms and makes them useful by way of a common metaphor.


2. Matplotlib
Matplotlib is the plotting library for Python that provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications. 
It is a close resemblance to MATLAB embedded in Python programming language. It is another library from the SciPy Stack which plots 2D figures. Matplotlib can be installed using pip: -m pip install –U matplotlib.
Uses : 
Histogram, bar plots, scatter plots, area plot to pie plot, Matplotlib can depict a wide range of visualizations like line plot, scatter plots, area plots etc.


3. NumPy 
NumPy is the essential package for scientific and mathematical computing in Python. 
It introduces n-dimensional arrays and matrices, which are necessary when performing sophisticated mathematical operations. 
It contains functions that perform basic operations on arrays, such as sorting, shaping, and other mathematical matrix operations. 
To install numpy first check the version of python. To check version run :  python 2/3 –V.Now install the library by running: pip install numpy
They are faster as they work in c level language.
  Uses:
 Basic and advanced array operations with mathematical computations making it faster as it runs in C speed. They can work in n-dimensional array.


4. Pandas
Pandas is an open-source Python package that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the labeled data in Python programming language. 
Pandas stand for Python Data Analysis Library. 
Generally Pandas work with dataframes.
It is designed for quick and easy data manipulation, reading, aggregation, and visualization.
Pandas take data in a CSV or TSV file or a SQL database and create a Python object with rows and columns called a data frame. Pandas can be installed by using pip: pip install pandas.
Uses:
Indexing, manipulation, renaming, updation, addyion, deletion of dataframes.
Imputation of missig  files and handling missing data.


5. SciPy
SciPy builds on the NumPy array object and is part of the stack which includes tools like Matplotlib, Pandas, and SymPy with additional tools,
SciPy library contains modules for efficient mathematical routines as linear algebra, interpolation, optimization, integration, and statistics. 
The main functionality of the SciPy library is built upon NumPy and its arrays. SciPy makes significant use of Numpy. 
Scipy can be installed using pip: pip install Scipy.
Uses:
SciPy uses arrays as its basic data structure. 
It has various modules to perform common scientific programming tasks as linear algebra, integration, calculus, ordinary differential equations, and signal processing.


6. Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. 
It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Installation can be done using pip install seaborn.
Uses:
Seaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs. 
It will be used to visualize random distributions.
