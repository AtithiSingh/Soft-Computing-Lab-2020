1.TensorFlow
What Is TensorFlow?
If you are currently working on a machine learning project in Python, then you may have heard about this popular open source library known as TensorFlow.
This library was developed by Google in collaboration with Brain Team. TensorFlow is a part of almost every Google application for machine learning.
TensorFlow works like a computational library for writing new algorithms that involve a large number of tensor operations, since neural networks can be easily expressed as computational graphs they can be implemented using TensorFlow as a series of operations on Tensors. Plus, tensors are N-dimensional matrices which represent your data.
Features of TensorFlow
TensorFlow is optimized for speed, it makes use of techniques like XLA for quick linear algebra operations.
1. Responsive Construct
With TensorFlow, we can easily visualize each and every part of the graph which is not an option while using Numpy or SciKit.
2. Flexible
One of the very important Tensorflow Features is that it is flexible in its operability, meaning it has modularity and the parts of it which you want to make standalone, it offers you that option.
3. Easily Trainable
It is easily trainable on CPU as well as GPU for distributed computing.
4. Parallel Neural Network Training
TensorFlow offers pipelining in the sense that you can train multiple neural networksand multiple GPUs which makes the models very efficient on large-scale systems.
5. Large Community
Needless to say, if it has been developed by Google, there already is a large team of software engineers who work on stability improvements continuously.
6. Open Source
The best thing about this machine learning library is that it is open source so anyone can use it as long as they have internet connectivity.
Uses of TensorFlow?
You are using TensorFlow daily but indirectly with applications like Google Voice Search or Google Photos. These are the  applications of TensorFlow.
All the libraries created in TensorFlow are written in C and C++. However, it has a complicated front-end for Python. Your Python code will get compiled and then executed on TensorFlow distributed execution engine built using C and C++.
The number of applications of TensorFlow is literally unlimited and that is the beauty of TensorFlow.
