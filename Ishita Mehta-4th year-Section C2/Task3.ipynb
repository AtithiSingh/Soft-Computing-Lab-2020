    "- Easy to use API – It is as simple as python can be.\n",
    "- Python support – As mentioned above, PyTorch smoothly integrates with the python data science stack. It is so similar to numpy that you might not even notice the difference.\n",
    "- Dynamic computation graphs – Instead of predefined graphs with specific functionalities, PyTorch provides a framework for us to build computational graphs as we go, and even change them during runtime. This is valuable for situations where we don’t know how much memory is going to be required for creating a neural network.\n",
    "- A few other advantages of using PyTorch are it’s multiGPU support, custom data loaders and simplified preprocessors."
